## User Guide

Plug in a USB-C cable, place the card on a flat surface, and put the deer and the sleigh onto the track. The three buttons at the bottom control the speed, there are three levels for each direction. The upper music button plays a Christmas Jingle accompanied by a small "dance".

## Working Principle
The propulsion is driven by the [Lorentz force law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force), which acts orthogonally to the directions of both the current flow and the magnetic field. By using magnets with poles aligned vertically (top and bottom) and positioning the PCB traces perpendicular to the track’s direction, the magnets experience a forward or backward force along the track based on the current direction.

The tracks are setup as two phases with 90-degree phase shift, allowing the same control as a bipolar stepper motor. A guard rail is also added to keep the magnets centered during curves. The guard rails are run along the outside of the track (parallel with track direction) which means an inwards force is generated instead.

For more detailed explanations of the working priciples, refer to **Jeff McBride’s** [blog post](https://jeffmcbride.net/gauss-speedway/).

## Design
The PCB consists of the phase tracks, guard rail, driver circuit and decoration circuit. The phases and guard rail are generated by Jeff's [curvycad](https://github.com/mcbridejc/curvycad/tree/main) plugin for KiCad. The driver circuit and the decoration circuit each have their own CH32 microcontroller, which communicate with each other using I2C. This was mainly done because of a lack of PWM channels.

### Driver circuit
The driver circuit controls the phase tracks and guard rails. The design is heavily based on Jeff’s design with some modifications for cost-effectiveness and USB compatibility:

* Power Supply: Utilizes 5V USB-C input instead of a barrel jack plug. The total current draw when moving is 500 mA.
* Microcontroller: Replaces the STM32 with the CH32V003, which is cheaper, ~20 cents! It is also 5V compatible.
* Motor Drivers: Uses DRV8833 motor drivers instead of ZXBM5210 for lower driver resistance (1.2 Ohms vs 0.3 Ohms), making the track a bit more efficient.

### Decoration circuit
A separate circuit using another CH32V003 handles LED control and buzzer music.

* CH32V003 microcontroller: Used for controlling decorative elements.
* I2C Communication: Links the decoration circuit with the driver circuit to synchronize dance.
* Buzzer: Plays a short Christmas jingle.
* LEDs: PWM brightness control through GPIOs for the 3D-printed village decoration. 


## Manufacturing

This year we made a total of 50 cards, all manufactured and assembled by JLC PCB. Each PCB then had decorations with trees and cottages attached, got rubber feet mounted, had one sleigh and one deer attached, was programmed, and was finally tested.

### Trees and cottages
The trees, cottage and ground are all one solid 3D-print, with a touch of white matte primer spray paint from above. Here, it is printed in 'army brown' PLA @ 0.2 mm layer height. Rectangular holes under the cottages give space for LEDs to illuminate them. This print was mounted to the PCB with 2 * M2.5x4mm screws.

### Sleigh and reindeer
The sleigh and reindeer are also 3D-printed, but are a bit different. The sleigh is one print with multiple filaments, while the deer consists of two different; a white base for the magnets and the reindeer itself in the same brown filament as the trees.

Mounting the magnets was quite tricky, and it is crucial to orient them correctly! We fine-tuned the models so that the magnets would press-fit into place. For the sleigh, a small drop of super glue was applied to the magnets before being pressed into the sleigh using a specialized fixture. The reindeer is simpler since the base is flat, the magnets were pressed in before the reindeer itself was mounted on top.

## Credits

Special thanks to **Jeff McBride**, this project was heavily inspired by his awesome [Gauss speedway](https://jeffmcbride.net/gauss-speedway/).

Also thank you **cnlohr** for the [ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) framework which was used to program the microcontrollers.

Thanks to **Ida Udd** for the beautiful design of the reindeer and **Rikard Karlsson** for helping us 3D print the sleighs in beautiful multi-color detail.
